TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS

Car accidents cause a lot of injuries and death. Data science can be used for good, and finding out why and how car accidents happen helps authorities and people prevent different fatalities.

Project Goal: 

Predict traffic accident rates for the road segments of Seattle City using road features such as geolocation, surface width, segment length, the slope of the segment. Finding out possible relationships of the road segments with accidents rates will have a number of applications:

Finding out possible causes of accidents will have a number of applications:

APPLICATIONS: 

Commuters make a daily safe route planning, emergency vehicles will be evenly allocated, cities will better design risky roads. 


DATA

In this project, three data sets are used: traffic volume data of the road segments(2016), road network data, traffic accident data(2016). All the data sets are from the open data of Seattle City.



Project structure:

1.
Open traffic data from Seattle city is obtained and merged with the traffic volume data of the city by corresponding each accident location to the nearest road segment in the traffic volume data.

2. The traffic volume data is merged with the road network data to get the road features for each road segment

3.
